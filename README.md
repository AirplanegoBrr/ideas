## Discord Client on web

We all know discord has discord.com/app but what if you wanted to host your own discord? SO what it would be is a 1 for 1 copy of discord but it wouldn't use discord.com links on the site (the server would send and get all the data for you) so it would look like ``Your computer -> Your server -> Discord`` then it would go ``Discord -> Your server -> Your computer``


This could be used to bypass school and work filters. Or maybe your conty doesnt like discord!

This would use a discord BOT to handle every thing (if it was using your discord account it would be a self bot)
